Odin project recipes

While working on the Odin project recipes project I demonstrated the abillities to create the initial structure on the index.html page. With the three recipes I have chosen I demonstrated that I knew how to attach links on the home page and I have the know how to ass a description of each dish, attach a picture of each dish, use a unordered list that inclue all the ingrediants, lastly I showed that I knew how to use a ordered list to help anyone that would like to make the dish. I did this for each of the three recipes on the main page.
